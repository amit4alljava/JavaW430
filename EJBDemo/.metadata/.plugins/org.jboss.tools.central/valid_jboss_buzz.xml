He discusses the evolution of existing frameworks and their integration with newer frameworks, such as those designed to support microservices and reactive programming, the impact of migrating applications to the cloud and the benefit to be gained from technologies such as Fabric8 and CD/CI.&nbsp; This is definitely worth reading if you want a better understanding of our future.</p><p style="min-height: 8pt; padding: 0px;">&nbsp;</p><h2>Why you should use Ceylon</h2><p style="min-height: 8pt; padding: 0px;">&nbsp;</p><p>This week sees the release of <a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://ceylon-lang.org/" rel="nofollow">Ceylon</a> 1.2, a phenomenal development effort that has been underway for the last year.&nbsp; Ceylon is a sophisticated programming language that is designed to run on the JVM and JavaScript virtual machines, as such it is often described as a true cross-platform language.&nbsp; <a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://ceylon-lang.org/blog/2015/10/27/why/" rel="nofollow">There are many other reasons why you should take a look at Ceylon and who better to describe some of these than Gavin King</a>.</p><p style="min-height: 8pt;

The discussion touches on the use cases for Infinispan as well as some of the new features that have been introduced.&nbsp; If this podcast intrigues you then also check out William's post on expiration in which he <a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://blog.infinispan.org/2015/10/expiration-enhancements.html" rel="nofollow">describes the behaviour present in previous releases and how this has been enhanced in Infinispan 8</a>.</p><p style="min-height: 8pt;

	<title>A Focus on Hibernate Changes</title>
	<summary type="html"><![CDATA[
      <div><div id="preamble">
      <div class="sectionbody">
      <div class="paragraph">
      <p>Over the past two years we have been working hard to rationalize and improve
      the support for different Hibernate versions in the JBoss Tools suite. This
      effort has resulted in real multiversion support but some of the changes may
      have an impact on the way how you tackle your Hibernate projects in JBoss Tools.
      Read on if you are a user of Hibernate reverse engineering tooling and of the
      Hibernate console configuration.</p>
      </div>
      </div>
      </div>
      <div class="sect1">
      <h2 id="why-did-we-need-these-changes-in-the-first-place"><a class="anchor" href="#why-did-we-need-these-changes-in-the-first-place"></a>Why Did We Need These Changes in the First Place?</h2>
      <div class="sectionbody">
      <div class="paragraph">
      <p>Already for a long time there was support for multiple Hibernate versions in
      JBoss Tools. When creating a console configuration for instance, it was possible
      to select the desired version using a dropdown box.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
      <p><span class="image"><img src="http://tools.jboss.org/blog/images/hibernate/2015-10-06/console-configuration-versions.png" alt="console-configuration-versions" /></span></p>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
      <p>After choosing the appropriate version for a console configuration, and using
      this console configuration for the reverse engineering of entity classes from
      the database, one can see below that effectively the selected version of Hibernate
      was used for the generation (in this case 4.0).</p>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
      <p><span class="image"><img src="http://tools.jboss.org/blog/images/hibernate/2015-10-06/tools-generation-4.0.0.png" alt="tools-generation-4.0.0" /></span></p>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
      <p>OK, so far so good. But when we needed to provide support for JPA 2.1
      we stumbled across a major problem. We added the Hibernate 4.3 runtime
      which contains JPA 2.1 support and all seemed to be going well. Unfortunately we found that expanding the
      created console configuration for JPA 2.1 projects resulted in the error message below.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
      <p><span class="image"><img src="http://tools.jboss.org/blog/images/hibernate/2015-10-06/hibernate-configuration-error.png" alt="hibernate-configuration-error" /></span></p>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
      <p>Investigation of this problem showed that there was a mixup of Hibernate classes due
      to a mistake in the dependency graph between the different Eclipse plugins that contained
      the respective Hibernate runtime contributions. At this point the dependencies looked
      like the schema below.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
      <p><span class="image"><img src="http://tools.jboss.org/blog/images/hibernate/2015-10-06/old-dependency-situation.png" alt="old-dependency-situation" /></span></p>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
      <p>It turned out that, no matter what Hibernate version you chose for the console configuration,
      expanding the configuration in the Eclipse view was always using the Hibernate 3.5 classes
      exposed by the <strong>org.hibernate.eclipse.libs</strong> plugin. To summarize, some of the functionality
      of the Hibernate tooling in Eclipse was using the chosen version properly while the rest of the
      functionality was always using version 3.5.</p>
      </div>
      </div>
      </div>
      <div class="sect1">
      <h2 id="ok-this-looks-messy-indeed-how-did-we-solve-it"><a class="anchor" href="#ok-this-looks-messy-indeed-how-did-we-solve-it"></a>OK This Looks Messy Indeed, How Did We Solve It?</h2>
      <div class="sectionbody">
      <div class="paragraph">
      <p>So the problem with the schema above is the direct dependency of the <strong>org.hibernate.eclipse</strong>
      plugin (as well as some other of the Hibernate tools Eclipse plugins) on <strong>org.hibernate.eclipse.libs</strong>.
      This last plugin contains the Hibernate 3.5 runtime as well as some other related libraries and it
      effectively hides the Hibernate runtime classes that are contributed by the different
      <strong>org.jboss.tools.hibernateX_Y</strong> plugins.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
      <p>The correct solution for this problem was, as is
      fairly classical in software engineering, to introduce an additional layer of indirection.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
      <p><span class="image"><img src="http://tools.jboss.org/blog/images/hibernate/2015-10-06/intermediate-dependency-situation.png" alt="intermediate-dependency-situation" /></span></p>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
      <p>As you can see above a new <strong>org.jboss.tools.hibernate.runtime.spi</strong> plugin was created. In the
      Hibernate tools Eclipse plugins only classes and interfaces from this SPI plugin are used while all the
      immediate uses on core Hibernate classes were removed. A number of runtime provider plugins then
      implement these SPI interfaces and contribute their functionality by means of the Eclipse
      extension point mechanism. Also the <strong>org.hibernate.eclipse.libs</strong> plugin was removed.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
      <p>As an additional step and to eliminate a lot of duplicated code in the different runtime
      plugins, we moved to a situation in which a lot of the code was moved to an abstract implementation
      of the Hibernate runtime providers. All the concrete uses of the actual Hibernate classes
      remained in the Hibernate runtime provider classes.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">

      <p>The most important change that can possibly effect you is the removal of the <strong>org.hibernate.eclipse.libs</strong>

      &lt;div&gt;
      &lt;div&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Over the past two years we have been working hard to rationalize and improve
      the support for different Hibernate versions in the JBoss Tools suite. This
      effort has resulted in real multiversion support but some of the changes may
      have an impact on the way how you tackle your Hibernate projects in JBoss Tools.
      Read on if you are a user of Hibernate reverse engineering tooling and of the
      Hibernate console configuration.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div&gt;
      &lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href="#why-did-we-need-these-changes-in-the-first-place" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Why Did We Need These Changes in the First Place?&lt;/h2&gt;
      &lt;div&gt;
      &lt;div&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Already for a long time there was support for multiple Hibernate versions in
      JBoss Tools. When creating a console configuration for instance, it was possible
      to select the desired version using a dropdown box.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;img src="http://tools.jboss.org/blog/images/hibernate/2015-10-06/console-configuration-versions.png" alt="console-configuration-versions"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;After choosing the appropriate version for a console configuration, and using
      this console configuration for the reverse engineering of entity classes from
      the database, one can see below that effectively the selected version of Hibernate
      was used for the generation (in this case 4.0).&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;img src="http://tools.jboss.org/blog/images/hibernate/2015-10-06/tools-generation-4.0.0.png" alt="tools-generation-4.0.0"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;OK, so far so good. But when we needed to provide support for JPA 2.1
      we stumbled across a major problem. We added the Hibernate 4.3 runtime
      which contains JPA 2.1 support and all seemed to be going well. Unfortunately we found that expanding the
      created console configuration for JPA 2.1 projects resulted in the error message below.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;img src="http://tools.jboss.org/blog/images/hibernate/2015-10-06/hibernate-configuration-error.png" alt="hibernate-configuration-error"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Investigation of this problem showed that there was a mixup of Hibernate classes due
      to a mistake in the dependency graph between the different Eclipse plugins that contained
      the respective Hibernate runtime contributions. At this point the dependencies looked
      like the schema below.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;img src="http://tools.jboss.org/blog/images/hibernate/2015-10-06/old-dependency-situation.png" alt="old-dependency-situation"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;It turned out that, no matter what Hibernate version you chose for the console configuration,
      expanding the configuration in the Eclipse view was always using the Hibernate 3.5 classes
      exposed by the &lt;strong&gt;org.hibernate.eclipse.libs&lt;/strong&gt; plugin. To summarize, some of the functionality
      of the Hibernate tooling in Eclipse was using the chosen version properly while the rest of the
      functionality was always using version 3.5.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div&gt;
      &lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href="#ok-this-looks-messy-indeed-how-did-we-solve-it" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;OK This Looks Messy Indeed, How Did We Solve It?&lt;/h2&gt;
      &lt;div&gt;
      &lt;div&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;So the problem with the schema above is the direct dependency of the &lt;strong&gt;org.hibernate.eclipse&lt;/strong&gt;
      plugin (as well as some other of the Hibernate tools Eclipse plugins) on &lt;strong&gt;org.hibernate.eclipse.libs&lt;/strong&gt;.
      This last plugin contains the Hibernate 3.5 runtime as well as some other related libraries and it
      effectively hides the Hibernate runtime classes that are contributed by the different
      &lt;strong&gt;org.jboss.tools.hibernateX_Y&lt;/strong&gt; plugins.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The correct solution for this problem was, as is
      fairly classical in software engineering, to introduce an additional layer of indirection.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;img src="http://tools.jboss.org/blog/images/hibernate/2015-10-06/intermediate-dependency-situation.png" alt="intermediate-dependency-situation"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;As you can see above a new &lt;strong&gt;org.jboss.tools.hibernate.runtime.spi&lt;/strong&gt; plugin was created. In the
      Hibernate tools Eclipse plugins only classes and interfaces from this SPI plugin are used while all the
      immediate uses on core Hibernate classes were removed. A number of runtime provider plugins then
      implement these SPI interfaces and contribute their functionality by means of the Eclipse
      extension point mechanism. Also the &lt;strong&gt;org.hibernate.eclipse.libs&lt;/strong&gt; plugin was removed.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;As an additional step and to eliminate a lot of duplicated code in the different runtime
      plugins, we moved to a situation in which a lot of the code was moved to an abstract implementation
      of the Hibernate runtime providers. All the concrete uses of the actual Hibernate classes
      remained in the Hibernate runtime provider classes.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;img src="http://tools.jboss.org/blog/images/hibernate/2015-10-06/current-dependency-situation.png" alt="current-dependency-situation"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div&gt;
      &lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href="#how-does-all-of-this-affect-me-avid-hibernate-tools-user" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;How Does All of This Affect Me, Avid Hibernate Tools User?&lt;/h2&gt;
      &lt;div&gt;
      &lt;div&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The most important change that can possibly effect you is the removal of the &lt;strong&gt;org.hibernate.eclipse.libs&lt;/strong&gt;
      plugin. Not only did this plugin contain the classes of the core Hibernate 3.5 runtime but it also
      included some Hibernate related classes that are considered optional. Among these where cache implementations
      such as &lt;strong&gt;Ehcache&lt;/strong&gt; and connection pool implementations such as &lt;strong&gt;C3P0&lt;/strong&gt;. As caching and connection
      pooling are not really relevant for the tooling and as there are way too many possible options
      for them to be all included in all of the Hibernate runtime providers, we decided to not include
      them anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;So if you include classes from these optional bundles in your Hibernate configuration file, you will
      probably bump against problems like &lt;a href="https://issues.jboss.org/browse/JBIDE-18299" target="_blank"&gt;this issue&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Assume like in this case that you want to use second level cache and use the Ehcache implementation. So you have
      written a Hibernate configuration file in which you have defined the session factory like as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div&gt;
      &lt;div&gt;
      &lt;pre&gt;&amp;lt;hibernate-configuration&amp;gt;
          &amp;lt;session-factory&amp;gt;
              &amp;lt;property name="hibernate.connection.driver_class"&amp;gt;org.h2.Driver&amp;lt;/property&amp;gt;
              &amp;lt;property name="hibernate.connection.url"&amp;gt;jdbc:h2:test&amp;lt;/property&amp;gt;
              &amp;lt;property name="hibernate.dialect"&amp;gt;org.hibernate.dialect.H2Dialect&amp;lt;/property&amp;gt;
      
              &amp;lt;property name="hibernate.cache.use_second_level_cache"&amp;gt;true&amp;lt;/property&amp;gt;
              &amp;lt;property name="hibernate.cache.use_query_cache"&amp;gt;true&amp;lt;/property&amp;gt;
              &amp;lt;property name="hibernate.cache.region.factory_class"&amp;gt;
                  org.hibernate.cache.ehcache.SingletonEhCacheRegionFactory
              &amp;lt;/property&amp;gt;
      
              &amp;lt;mapping class="..."/&amp;gt;
      		...
          &amp;lt;/session-factory&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;/hibernate-configuration&amp;gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;When you create a Hibernate console configuration in Eclipse using this definition, and you will try to
      expand it, this will result in an error like shown below. Evidently, because the &lt;strong&gt;org.hibernate.eclipse.libs&lt;/strong&gt;
      plugin containing the &lt;strong&gt;org.hibernate.cache.ehcache.SingletonEhCacheRegionFactory&lt;/strong&gt; class was removed, a
      ClassNotFoundException will be the cause of this SessionFactory error.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;img src="http://tools.jboss.org/blog/images/hibernate/2015-10-06/session-factory-error.png" alt="session-factory-error"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;This problem can be solved in two possible ways. The first way is to add the jar files containing the missing
      classes to the project class path. As can be seen on the image below, the console configuration can now be
      expanded without an error.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div&gt;

      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;One can argue that it is not a very clean solution to pollute the project class path with artifacts that are
      not really needed just to make the tooling run properly. This is a valid point and it is
      the reason why we have a second solution that is probably preferable.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;In this case you can just edit the
      console configuration by using 'Edit Configuration' from the context menu. In the opened dialog, you can
      switch to the Classpath page and add the missing jar files. The image below illustrates this approach.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div&gt;
      &lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href="#conclusion" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
      &lt;div&gt;
      &lt;div&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Because of the architectural changes that we implemented for the Eclipse Hibernate tooling, real support for
      multiple versions of Hibernate is now available and working properly.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The removal of the
      &lt;strong&gt;org.hibernate.eclipse.libs&lt;/strong&gt; plugin introduced the possibility of missing some classes when working with the
      Hibernate console configuration in Eclipse. As we showed, this can be easily fixed by directly adding the
      libraries containing the missing classes on the class path of the console configuration.&lt;/p&gt;

      <p>OpenShift 3 tooling is provided as a TechPreview feature, available from the JBoss Central Software/Updates page.

      <p>But despite the fact that OpenShift 3 is still in TechPreview status in this release there are many improvements.

      Remember that since Beta1 we require Java 8 for installing and using of
      JBoss Tools. We still support developing and running applications using older Java runtimes. See more in &lt;a href="http://tools.jboss.org/blog/2015-06-23-beta1-for-mars.html#java-8-to-run-eclipse-older-runtimes-ok-for-builds-deployment" target="_blank"&gt;Beta1 blog&lt;/a&gt;.

      &lt;p&gt;New server adapters for JBoss EAP 7 and WildFly 10 have been added to the toolset, allowing you to enjoy all the past benefits, but with all the newest runtimes.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;This will first display the dialog to create and start a LiveReload server.
      Then, this will open the current element (a selected file in the Project Explorer, a selected module in the Servers view or the content of the active editor)
      in the browser, without even having to use the 'Open With&amp;gt;Web Browser via LiveReload Server' contextual menu.&lt;/p&gt;

If you want to learn more about Infinispan (and its associate Red Hat Product, JBoss Data Grid) and attend the &lt;a href="https://partnerconf2015.redhat.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;Red Hat EMEA Partner Conf 2015&lt;/a&gt;, please come to my lab on &lt;a href="https://partnerconf2015.redhat.com/?q=content/5-things-you-must-know-about-jboss-data-grid" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;5 Things You Should Know on JBoss Data Grid &lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;for a quick, and hands on, introduction to the matter.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you are already familiar with Infinispan, a couple of very interesting articles has been released last week. The first one is &lt;a href="http://blog.infinispan.org/2015/09/memory-based-eviction.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;Infinispan: Memory based eviction&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;- and eviction being at the core of the product, you will certainly appreciate this nice walk-through from William Burns of the internal design. The other one is the first of a series of article from &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="http://blog.thomasqvarnstrom.com/2015/09/scaleable-events-with-jboss-data-grid.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;Thomas Qvarnstr&amp;ouml;m on JBoss Tech Blog: Scaleable Events with JBoss Data Grid - part 1 Overview of Events&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. Events in Infinispan are a very simple and yet powerful way to implements logic on data changes or insert, leveraging the very scalable and distributed nature of the grid. Just take a peak at this article and I'm sure you'll see what I mean here &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span aria-label="Wink"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Wildfly 10 is coming...&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;... Soon. So soon in fact, that &lt;a href="http://wildfly.org/news/2015/09/24/WildFly10-CR2-Released/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;WildFly 10 CR2 has been released&lt;/a&gt; and that Markus made a nice overview of its key feature: &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="http://blog.eisele.net/2015/09/wildfly-10-cr-2-released-java-ee-7-java.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;Java EE 7, Java 8, Hibernate 5, JavaScript Support with Hot Reloading&lt;/a&gt;. Enjoy the preview, and rest assure, you won't be waiting for too long for the GA.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="http://design.jboss.org/wildfly/logo/final/wildfly_logo_stacked_600px.png" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://design.jboss.org/wildfly/logo/final/wildfly_logo_stacked_600px.png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Technological bits (or bytes)&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First of all, let's take it easy by starting with a video - no coding, nor reading to do, just enjoy the &lt;a href="http://wei-meilin.blogspot.de/2015/09/red-hat-jboss-fuse-tools-make-your.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;JBoss Fuse - Tools make your world go round, the slides and basics&lt;/a&gt;, and learn :&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;How to debug Camel application using the tooling provides.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Data mapping between POJO and XML, JSON with Dozer with drag and drops only.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Deploy and package an OSGi ready Applications.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Then, our own Kenny Peeples will take you through the&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.ossmentor.com/2015/09/more-detail-on-data-virtualization-62.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;the new feature Data Virtualization 6.2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. In case you are not aware of this, Data Virtualization is the Red Hat products associated to the Open Source project Teiid, which, by the way, have been recently named &lt;a href="https://developerblog.redhat.com/2015/09/25/repost-gluster-and-teiid-infoworld-bossie-award-winners/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;"Best Open Source Application"&lt;/a&gt; by InfoWorld Bossie Awards. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;A nice, simple read here again, but now let's go up a notch, and look at &lt;a href="http://narayana.io/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;Narayana&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Narayana is the implementation of the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.google.de/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;amp;ion=1&amp;amp;espv=2&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8#q=5th%20amendment%20definition" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;Java Transaction Service&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, which is of course a crucial, internal part of our JEE server Wildfly. That being said, most likely - or at least for most of you, you will never interact directly with it. However, now that &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="http://jbossts.blogspot.de/2015/09/jts-docker-container.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;Narayana team has released a JTS Docker Container&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, it gives you the opportunity to easily test this framework and see for yourself the intricate complexities of transaction management (if you think that this matter is simple, try, like me to read &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Java-Transaction-Processing-Design-Implementation/dp/013035290X" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;Mark Little's book on the topic&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; and call me when you hit the first bottle of aspirin...). IMHO, it is quite crucial to any application developer to have a fair grasp of transaction management - at least to know when NOT to use them and when you actually CAN'T go without them. This light docker container might be an easy for you to test it or demonstrate it*.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;OK, let's go even further with &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.optaplanner.org/blog/2015/09/30/HowLuckyAreYourRandomSeeds.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;OptaPlanner - How lucky are your random seeds ?&lt;/a&gt; But&lt;span&gt;, on this one, I'll take the 5th amendment (even if I'm no citizen of the US), because my knowledge of OptaPlanner is sketchy at best, and to make it worse, I really suck at statistics and math. But if you are into any of those, you'll bet you'll find yourself a nice gift in this article...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;* This docker container for JTS does not count as a Docker related news - not changing the title of this weekly editorial !&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Releases, releases, releases&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On top of the &lt;a href="http://kverlaen.blogspot.de/2015/09/jbpm-63-released.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;jBPM 6.3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; and&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="http://blog.athico.com/2015/09/drools-630final-released.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;Drools 6.3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;already mentioned above, the rest of the JBoss Community has not been resting, idle, and has delivered, as always, a fair amount of new version in the last week:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Drools &amp;amp; jBPM:&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://kverlaen.blogspot.de/2015/09/jbpm-63-released.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;Processes, Rules and Events: jBPM 6.3 released&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://blog.athico.com/2015/09/drools-630final-released.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;Drools 6.3.0.Final released&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hibernate ORM&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://in.relation.to/2015/09/30/hibernate-orm-502-final-release/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;Second bug-fix release for ORM 5.0&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Arquillian&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://arquillian.org/blog/2015/09/30/arquillian-governor-1-0-0-Final/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;Arquillian Governor 1.0.0.Final Released&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://arquillian.org/blog/2015/09/29/descriptors-2-0-0-alpha-8/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;ShrinkWrap Descriptors 2.0.0-alpha-8 Released&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://arquillian.org/blog/2015/09/27/arquillian-recorder-1-1-0-Alpha2/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;Arquillian Recorder 1.1.0.Alpha2 Released&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- [DocumentBodyEnd:2eec7ba2-8ad2-4d21-96c1-5a2537bc2537] --&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;
